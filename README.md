## Mapping_Earthquakes

### Overview:The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.To complete this project, we use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and using JavaScript and the D3.js library we retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes for the last seven days. 
### We then use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

### Purpose: We created the earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. For the challenge we are would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and see the data on a third map.
